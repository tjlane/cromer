The following is a transcript of an email sent
from JON TISCHLER to TJ LANE on 11/12/2012
---------------------------------------------

Instructions:

go into the make_cromer folder and build and run main.c.  This should create the file "XSECTDAT2X.BIN".  It will also create "RECORD.LIST" which you do not need.

copy XSECTDAT2X.BIN to wherever the final executable will be.  The executable needs XSECTDAT2X.BIN to run.

build and run main.c,get_fp.c
When you run it, use the default values of Zr and 8 keV.

This should produce the same values shown in "old result"

When I run it my console shows:


Running…
warning: this program uses gets(), which is unsafe.
give the atom type (i.e. Fe+3), ['Zr']: 
give the energy (KeV) [<cr> --> 8] 
give the H vector (2π/d) [<cr> --> 0] 
 fo(Zr, 1.5498 Ang) = 39.9947,     mu/rho = 130.79 (cm^2/g)
 df(Zr, 8 keV) = 39.6834 + i 2.26738
